By Decorators we can easily implement Singleton Class But it has it's own pros and cons

    Pros
    
    Decorators are additive in a way that is often more intuitive than multiple inheritance.
    Cons
    
    While objects created using MyClass() would be true singleton objects, MyClass itself is a function, not a class, so you cannot call class methods from it.
