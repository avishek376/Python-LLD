Low Level Design Problems in Python

```
Hi folks 🧑‍💻,
This repository contains the solutions of the low level design problems in Python. 
The structures/patterns and examples are taken from the internet and the solutions are written by me.
I tried to write the code in a way that it can be easily understood by anyone and can be used as a reference.
I followed Refactoring Guru for the design patterns and GeeksforGeeks for the problems.



The code is written in Python 3.9 
```
